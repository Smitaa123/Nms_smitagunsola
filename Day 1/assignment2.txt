Real-World Applications for Parallel Computing


1.Weather Forecasting
How Used: Weather prediction models process vast amounts of atmospheric data, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity, using numerical simulations. Parallel computing divides this computation into smaller chunks that run simultaneously on multiple processors.
Why Important: This accelerates simulations, allowing meteorologists to make real-time forecasts and issue timely warnings for severe weather events like hurricanes or tornadoes.

2.Gaming and 3D Rendering
How Used: Modern video games and animations use parallel computing in GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to render high-resolution graphics in real-time.
Why Important: Ensures smooth, immersive gameplay and realistic graphics, meeting the high demand of users in the entertainment industry.



Real-World Applications for Networked Systems


1. Online Banking and Financial Services
How Used: Networked systems connect customer interfaces (e.g., mobile apps, ATMs) with centralized banking databases. Transactions are processed, verified, and recorded in real time over secure networks.
Why Important: Ensures secure, reliable, and fast access to financial services, facilitating billions of daily transactions globally.

2. Healthcare Systems
How Used: Hospital information systems connect various departments (labs, radiology, pharmacy) and external entities (insurance companies, remote specialists) via a network. Patients' data is stored and shared securely for collaborative care.
Why Important: Enhances patient outcomes by improving coordination, reducing delays, and enabling telemedicine services.
